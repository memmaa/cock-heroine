REM Looks like this file used to be a batch script in a former life!

REM Step 1: Build Cock Heroine (from within Qt Creator, or however. Make note of the location where the .exe is produced)
REM Step 2: Run this script (make sure the path to the exe is the one you just built)
REM Step 3: Clear up unwanted files from the build directory, collect 'em all up and put somewhere for people to use.

REM Not sure why this doesn't work. :-/
REM set PATH="C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\mingw73_32\bin;%PATH%"
REM windeployqt.exe C:\Users\mm\Programming\Cpp\build-CockHeroine-Desktop_Qt_5_12_12_MinGW_32_bit-Release\release\CockHeroine.exe

REM Use the full path instead
REM C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\mingw73_32\bin\windeployqt.exe C:\Users\mm\Programming\Cpp\build-CockHeroine-Desktop_Qt_5_12_12_MinGW_32_bit-Release\release\CockHeroine.exe
REM The above doesn't work either!!

REM Actual solution:
REM Open the Qt command prompt (C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /A /Q /K C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\mingw73_32\bin\qtenv2.bat)
REM Then cd to the release directory: cd C:\Users\mm\Programming\Cpp\build-CockHeroine-Desktop_Qt_5_12_12_MinGW_32_bit-Release\release
REM Now run: windeployqt CockHeroine.exe
REM for 64-bit, change mingw73_32 to mingw73_64:
REM C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\mingw73_64\bin\qtenv2.bat
REM cd C:\Users\mm\Programming\Cpp\build-CockHeroine-Desktop_Qt_5_12_12_MinGW_64_bit-Release\release
REM windeployqt CockHeroine.exe

C:\Qt\Qt5.12.12\5.12.12\mingw73_32\bin\qtenv2.bat
cd C:\Users\mm\Programming\Cpp\build-CockHeroine-Desktop_Qt_5_12_12_MinGW_32_bit-Release\release
windeployqt CockHeroine.exe
